## Car Price Prediction Project

With the covid 19 impact in the market, we have seen lot of changes in the car market. Now some cars are in demand hence making them costly and some are not in demand hence cheaper. One of our clients works with small traders, who sell used cars. With the change in market due to covid 19 impact, our client is facing problems with their previous car price valuation machine learning models. So, they are looking for new machine learning models from new data.

* In this problem, we investigate the application of supervised
machine learning techniques to predict the price of used cars
in India. The predictions are based on historical data collected
from websites.

* Different techniques like (Linear Regression, Random Forest
Regression, Bagging Regressor, XGB Regressor, ADA
Boost Regressor, Regularization (Lasso), Regularization
(Ridge), Gradient Boosting Regressor ) have been used to
make the predictions.

### PIPELINE

* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Pre-processing
* Model Building
* Model Evaluation
* Selecting the best model


### Data Sources and their formats
The sample data was scrapped from Cars24.com by using
selenium web-driver in python programming language.
A total of three data types in the data set Int and Object.
The data collected was saved in .CSV (comma-separated
values) format.
