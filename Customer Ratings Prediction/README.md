* The rise in E — commerce, has brought a significant rise in the
importance of customer reviews.

* There are hundreds of review sites online and massive amounts of
reviews for every product.

* Customers have changed their way of shopping and according to a
recent survey, 70 percent of customers say that they use rating filters
to filter out low rated items in their searches.

* The ability to successfully decide whether a review will be helpful to
other customers and thus give the product more exposure is vital to
companies that support these reviews, companies like Google, Amazon
and Yelp!.

The goal is to build a model that will extract information from textbased
data and predict the corresponding customer ratings.

In terms of model building we have two columns “Review” column and
“Rating” column. There are 5 values of rating ranging from (1 to 5).
Models used for extracting information from text based reviews:
* Bags of words model
* Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency model (TF-IDF)

Classification model used:
* Naive Bayes
* Logistic Regression.

### STEPS

* Scrapping more than 20,000 customer reviewes from Amazon.com,FLipkart.com using Python Selenium
* Text preprocessing using various NLTK techniques
* The target has 5 classification (1 star rating to 5 star rating)
* This is a Multi class classification problem
* Using GNB and Logistic regression 
* Building a ANN
* Checking various performance metrics
