### Libraries used for Exploratory data analysis

* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

As an aspiring Data Scientist the goal is to apply my analytical skills to
give findings and conclusions in detailed data analysis written in
jupyter notebook.

This analysis will then be used by the E-commerce retailers to
understand how exactly the variables are related to each other and
