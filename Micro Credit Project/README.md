* A Microfinance institution is an organization that offers financial services to low-income populations.

* Almost all Microfinance institutions give loans to their members, and many offers insurance, deposit and other services. Microfinance Institution (MFI) is an organization that offers financial services to low-income populations.

* MFS becomes very useful when targeting especially the unbanked poor families living in remote areas with not much sources of income. The Microfinance services (MFS) provided by MFI are Group Loans, Agricultural Loans, Individual Business Loans and so on.

The goal is to build a model which can be used to predict in terms of a probability for each loan transaction, whether the customer will be paying back the loaned amount within 5 days of insurance of loan.

In terms of model building the target variable (label) is categorical in nature so we need to solve this as a classification problem.
If the Label ‘1’ indicates that the loan has been paid i.e., non-defaulter, while, Label ‘0’ indicates that the loan has not been paid i.e., defaulter.

A total of 7 classification models were used in order to classify the target variable Label.
* Logistic Regression.
* Naive Bayes.
* Random Forest Classification.
* Decision Tree Classification.
* ADA Boost Classifier.
* K-NN Classifier.
* Gradient Boosting Classifier
