### MALIGNANT COMMENTS CLASSIFICATION

* Nowadays users leave numerous comments on different social
networks, news portals, and forums. Some of the comments are
toxic or abusive.
* Due to numbers of comments, it is unfeasible to manually
moderate them, so most of the systems use some kind of
automatic discovery of toxicity using machine learning models.
* Toxic comments are defined as comments that are rude,
disrespectful, or that tend to force users to leave the discussion.
* If these toxic comment can be automatically identified, we could
have safer discussions on various social networks, news portals,
or online forums.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal is to build a model that will extract information from
text-based data and predict whether the comment was toxic or
non-toxic.

Models used for extracting information from text based reviews:
* Bags of words model
* Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency model (TFIDF)

Classification model used:
* Naive Bayes
* Logistic Regression.
* Random Forest.
* Linear SVC.
