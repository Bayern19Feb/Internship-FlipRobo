Traffic control and vehicle owner identification has become major problem in every country. Sometimes it becomes difficult to identify vehicle owner who violates traffic rules and drives too fast. Therefore, it is not possible to catch and punish those kinds of people because the traffic personal might not be able to retrieve vehicle number from the moving vehicle because of the speed of the vehicle. Therefore, there is a need to develop Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system as a one of the solutions to this problem.

### Steps

* Data Collection
* Building Deep Learning Model
* OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
* Building a web app using flask

### Technologies used

* Open CV (Image Preprocessing and Data Preprocessing)
* Python (Numpy, Sklearn, Pandas, Matplotlib, PIL)
* Framework (Flask)
* Tensorflow (Training Deeplearning model)
* Google's Tesseract OCR (To extract text from image)

### Basic Pipeline

* Labelling the data
* Training the model
* Saving the model
* OCR
* Restful API

### Drawbacks

* OCR is not 100 % accurate the image has to be Distinct to extract the exact text
* Results can be improved using more training data. Only 250 images were used, use more images for better results
