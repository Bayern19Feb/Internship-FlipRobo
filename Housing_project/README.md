### HOUSING: PRICE PREDICTION

* Houses are one of the necessary need of each and every person around
the globe and therefore housing and real estate market is one of the
markets which is one of the major contributors in the world’s
economy.
* Data science comes as a very important tool to solve problems in the
domain to help the companies increase their overall revenue, profits,
improving their marketing strategies and focusing on changing trends
in house sales and purchases.
* Real estate is the least transparent industry in our ecosystem. Housing
prices keep changing day in and day out and sometimes are hype
rather than being based on valuation. Predicting housing prices with
real factors is the main crux of our project.

* As an aspiring Data Scientist the goal is to create a model that will
predict the house prices with the available independent variables.
This model will then be used by the management to understand how
exactly the prices vary with the variables.
* The company can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and
concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model
will be a good way for the management to understand the pricing
dynamics of a new market.
* Based on all the independent variables the model needs to predict
dependent variable (Sale Price)
