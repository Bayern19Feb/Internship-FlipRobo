### Image Scraping and Classification Project

* Image classification has gained lot of attention due to its
application in different computer vision tasks such as remote
sensing, scene analysis, surveillance, object detection, and image
retrieval.

* The primary goal of image classification is to assign the class
labels to images according to the image contents.
Images are one of the major sources of data in the field of data
science and AI. This field is making appropriate use of information
that can be gathered through images by examining its features
and details.

* The idea behind this project is to build a deep learning-based
Image Classification model on images that will be scraped from
e-commerce portal(Amazon.in). This is done to make the model
more and more robust.

* As an aspiring Data Scientist the goal is to apply my analytical
skills to give findings and conclusions in detailed data analysis
written in jupyter notebook.

* The main goal of the project is to scrap image data namely three
categories (Sarees (women) , Trousers (men), Jeans (men)) from
Amazon.com. This data will be provided as an input to your deep
learning model.
